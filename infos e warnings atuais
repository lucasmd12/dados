Okay, compreendi. Aquela parte do texto que você copiou era a descrição do problema que estávamos enfrentando com o método `createVoiceRoom` e a lista `participants`, e as ações que eu planejava tomar para corrigi-los.

Pelo último `flutter analyze` que você compartilhou, parece que a correção que eu solicitei para mover o método `createVoiceRoom` para dentro da classe `FirebaseService` e ajustar a lista `participants` **funcionou**. O erro de "método não definido" relacionado a `createVoiceRoom` na classe `FirebaseService` não aparece mais na lista de problemas.

Agora, o `flutter analyze` lista apenas 127 issues, que são warnings e infos. Isso é um bom sinal! Conseguimos resolver os erros críticos.

A lista atual de warnings e infos inclui coisas como:

*   Pacotes importados que não estão nas dependências (`depend_on_referenced_packages`).
*   Campos ou variáveis locais que não estão sendo usados (`unused_field`, `unused_local_variable`, `unused_element`).
*   Uso de APIs depreciadas (`deprecated_member_use`).
*   Chamadas assíncronas que usam `BuildContext` sem a devida verificação (`use_build_context_synchronously`).
*   Comparações desnecessárias com `null` (`unnecessary_null_comparison`).
*   Uso de tipos privados em APIs públicas (`library_private_types_in_public_api`).
*   Recomendações de interpolação de strings (`prefer_interpolation_to_compose_strings`).
*   Uso incorreto de `notifyListeners` (`invalid_use_of_visible_for_testing_member`, `invalid_use_of_protected_member`).
*   Comparações de tipos não relacionados (`unrelated_type_equality_checks`).
*   Expressões `null-aware` que nunca serão executadas (`dead_null_aware_expression`).
